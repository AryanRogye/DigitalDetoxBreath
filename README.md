# Digital Detox Breath

This app is inspired by the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.

This is a watchOS + iOS app
- Primarily designed for watchOS
  - Apple just requires all watchOS apps to have a companion iOS, so i had to make one as well

## How This App Connects to Digital Minimalism
The book mentions taking a digital detox, what to do during this detox?

But here’s the reality:
- My Apple Watch isn’t optional.
- For a lot of people, wearables are part of their routine (fitness, notifications, health).
- Completely “disconnecting” isn’t realistic when your life depends on your tech.
So instead of fighting the device, this app uses the watch as a tool to support the detox, not break it.

What the app gives you:
- A guided breathing flow (inhale → hold → exhale)
- Haptics synced to each breathing phase
- A minimal UI designed to calm you down, not stimulate you
- A quick way to reset during stressful moments of digital overload

Basically:
If you can’t escape your tech, at least let it help you slow down.
